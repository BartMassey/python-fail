# Python Fail
Copyright Â© 2014 Bart Massey

This repo documents some of the failings of the Python
programming language that I have discovered as I have taught
it in introductory programming classes. These problems are
significant both for beginning programmers and for software
engineers. In each case, I have tried to suggest solutions
that could be incorporated in a PEP to ameliorate the
problem.

I have quite a bit of experience with programming language
design and implementation, but I am in no way a Python
guru. I would be grateful for corrections, suggestions and
constructive critique.

In no particular order:

* append-fail: The choice of `+=` as an append operator causes confusion.
* expr-fail: Implicit conversions between boolean and
  integer values combine badly with odd precedence rules. 
* module-fail: Module variable scope rules are confusing, and
  the existence of function attributes makes them worse.
* nil-fail: The empty list is an lvalue, with odd consequences.
* replicate-fail: The list multiply operator doesn't copy
  (or even shallow copy) its prototype, inhibiting 2D array creation.
* scope-fail: Adding an assignment to a Python program can
  change the scoping of its variables in surprising ways.
