# Python Expression Fail
Copyright Â© 2014 Bart Massey

Python's operator precedences are somewhat odd. Boolean and
integer values are auto-interconverted. This leads to some
surprising interpretations of expressions.

`exprfail.py` shows some examples; `exprfail.c` and
`exprfail.5c` are comparisons with C and Nickle.
